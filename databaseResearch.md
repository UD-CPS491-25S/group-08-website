# Database Research

## Database Options

### 1. **Neo4J**
- Lexie working on this one, but overall looks great for visualization and easy to work with.
- Can build the database using a node-like structure

### 2. **MongoDB**
- When building a database here you can either bulding using Shell, Compass (their application i belive), or just through an application like VSCode.
    - I tried all 3, the Shell option you had to use "HomeBrew" with which I was nto familiar with and did spend a lot of time on but still was kind of frustrating to work with.
    - The Compass option again was very complex and confusing and would take time for all of us to learn how to use it.
    - I created a collection based of the heriarchy we made earlier on VSCode and then ran it through that to see add it to the database (This is in my working branch). This was obviously super simple and easy to use but there is little to no visualization with the database once we have the information in it. The only real visualization I got was just when teh data was used and when I connected to Mongo. The rest is just snippets of what code what sent through.
- Overall I think this could work, but I think if Neo4J works out well that will be the better option. I really think it would be nice to have something visual rather than snippets of code of what is going to the database.

### 3. **MySQL**
- I started to work with MySQL but when building it, it asked for a "Support Identifier" which I found is like a code that you would get from your company/organization, and could not find one for UD. The other option if you do not have a Support Identifier is to pay, so I do not think this would be a good option.

## Conclusion

### Next Steps
- Meet with the other group to see what they have found, and if we want to share a databse or not.
