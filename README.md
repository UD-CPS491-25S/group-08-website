## Project Description
Jakeâ€™s on Devine is requesting a POS system, or Point of Sale system, ultimately a place to store all essential restaurant related information including sales, inventory, payment, trends in data, etc.

Splitting roles wiht Group 02. Group 08 is working most directly with the "waiter/waitress" aspect of this system by allowing for subtraction of items from the database, an automatically populated reciept, and summarizing totals. 

## Technical Details
### Database Information
- Database testing with Neo4J (most likely best option)
- Developing script to be able to automatically populate the database if information needs to be updated (ex. quantitiy, price, item)
### Tech Stack
- Javascript
- HTML
- Express.JS
- Figma (https://www.figma.com/design/AXC6qapJKvmxbS3UFPUcJq/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=Wm1965rzvOeW7Dx2-1)

## Understanding Meeting One
1. This is a POS system. It is going to be used to track inventory, and adding/subtracting from a database, etc.
This will include: weekly totals, considering when things go bad, identifying trends to end users such as the owner.
2. Categories of Food, Beverage, Apparel
    This will then let us break these categories into at least 3 sub categories (tiers) so that we can test with products from Jake's real menu.
3. Need to decide what database we want to use, MongoDB vs Neo4J
4. SPRINT 1 will include working with the other team for how we want to represent data MAYBE? 

## Organizing our Schema
This is option one for a scema/layout for the system. We used the menu on Jakes website for our sample items.
