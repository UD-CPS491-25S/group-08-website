## Understanding Meeting One
1. This is a POS system. It is going to be used to track inventory, and adding/subtracting from a database, etc.
This will include: weekly totals, considering when things go bad, identifying trends to end users such as the owner.
2. Categories of Food, Beverage, Apparel
    This will then let us break these categories into at least 3 sub categories (tiers) so that we can test with products from Jake's real menu.
3. Need to decide what database we want to use, MongoDB vs Neo4J
4. SPRINT 1 will include working with the other team for how we want to represent data MAYBE? 

## Organizing our Schema
This is option one for a scema/layout for the system. We used the menu on Jakes website for our sample items.
